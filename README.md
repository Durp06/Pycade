# Pycade
My final APCS project. Basically gonna be a collection of smaller, simpler projects written in python. Why? because i wanted to and i couldnt think of anything else.


Im trying to add a forced import thingy or something but at the moment to get this project to work you need to import...

Pygame: **pip install pygame**
Open CV: **pip install opencv-python**

Then you run the **pycade.py** file to start the project and have fun :3
